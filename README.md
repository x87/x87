### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid fan of modding of older Grand Theft Auto series games (anything pre-GTA IV) for which I create tools and document things in my spare time.
I love reverse engineering, binary file analysis and compilers. TypeScript and Rust are my favorite programming languages. He/him.
