### Hi there 👋

I'm an avid fan of modding of older Grand Theft Auto series games (anything pre-GTA IV) for which I create tools and document things in my spare time.
I love reverse engineering, binary file analysis and compilers. TypeScript is my favorite programming language. A novice Rustacean. He/him.
